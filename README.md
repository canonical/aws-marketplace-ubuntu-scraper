# AWS Marketplace Ubuntu AMI Scraper

CLI to return the Ubuntu AMIs in AWS marketplace

## Basic setup

Install from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/aws-marketplace-ubuntu-scraper/)

```
$ pip install aws-marketplace-ubuntu-scraper
```

... OR ...

Install the requirements manually:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will also need [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) installed and [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) available in your PATH.

For running the `quicklaunch-report`, you also need the `simplestreams` snap installed:

```
snap install simplestreams
```

I recommend you create a new IAM user with no permissions granted. 
Ensure that you have opted in to all the AWS regions that are opt in only and 
that you want quicklaunch listings for. 

You will also need to set up your aws credentials for use with [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html)

Run the application:
```
$ python -m aws_marketplace_ubuntu_scraper --help

# Print details of the Ubuntu quicklaunch entries for each region
$ python -m aws_marketplace_ubuntu_scraper quicklaunch --iam-account-id="YOUR IAM ACCOUNT ID" --iam-username="YOUR IAM USERNAME" --iam-password="YOUR IAM PASSSWORD"

# Print details of the Ubuntu marketplace listings
$ python -m aws_marketplace_ubuntu_scraper marketplace

```

To run the tests:
```
    $ pytest
```
